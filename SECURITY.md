## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.
Instead, report it responsibly using one of the following methods:

- **Private message** to the maintainer (if applicable)

When reporting a vulnerability, include as much detail as possible:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Affected versions
- Potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept (PoC), if available

You can expect an initial response **within 48–72 hours**.

## Disclosure Process

Once a vulnerability is reported:

1. The issue will be reviewed and validated.
2. A fix or mitigation will be developed.
3. A patched release will be published if necessary.
4. The reporter may be credited, unless anonymity is requested.

Public disclosure will occur **only after a fix is available**, or when mitigation guidance has been provided.
