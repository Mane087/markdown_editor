# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. 🚀
Contributions are welcome and appreciated, whether they are bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, or code contributions.

This guide describes the workflow and rules to keep the project consistent, maintainable, and easy to collaborate on.

---

## Project Scope

This project focuses on:

- Providing an online Markdown editor
- Simplifying the creation and editing of `.md` files
- Offering common Markdown features such as headings, code blocks, images, lists, and shortcuts

When contributing, please ensure your proposal aligns with these goals.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features or improvements
- Improving documentation
- Fixing issues or refactoring code
- Adding or improving Markdown shortcuts or editor actions

Small, focused contributions are preferred over large, unrelated changes.

---

## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug:

- Verify the issue has not already been reported
- Test using the latest version of the project

When opening an issue, include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshots or logs if applicable
- Browser and operating system details

Do **not** report security vulnerabilities in public issues. Refer to `SECURITY.md` instead.

---

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests should:

- Clearly describe the problem being solved
- Explain why the feature is useful
- Fit within the scope of a Markdown editor

Avoid proposing overly complex features that significantly increase project complexity without clear benefits.

---

## Development Setup

Basic workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your change
4. Make your changes following the project conventions
5. Commit your changes with a clear message
6. Push the branch to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request

---

## Coding Guidelines

To keep the codebase clean and consistent:

- Follow existing code style and structure
- Keep functions and components small and readable
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies
- Write clear and meaningful commit messages

If your change affects UI behavior, include screenshots or short demos.

---

## Documentation

Documentation is as important as code.

When adding or modifying features:

- Update the README if user-facing behavior changes
- Update or create documentation files when needed
- Keep explanations concise and accurate

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

Pull Requests should:

- Address a single issue or feature
- Include a clear description of the changes
- Reference related issues if applicable
- Pass existing checks and builds

Incomplete or unfocused Pull Requests may be requested for revision.
