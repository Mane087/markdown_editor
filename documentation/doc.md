# Description

[MD-Editor](https://mane087.github.io/markdown_editor/) is an open source project designed to facilitate the creation and editing of Markdown (.md) files.

The main objective of the project is to offer an intuitive and practical online tool that covers most of the common needs when documenting projects, writing technical guides, or creating content in Markdown.

The application is designed for both developers and anyone who needs to write clear, structured documentation without worrying about remembering all the syntax of the language.

## Key features

MD-Editor offers an optimized editing experience through visual tools and keyboard shortcuts that streamline your workflow.
The editor features a set of interactive buttons that allow you to automatically insert common Markdown elements, such as:

- Headings
- Code blocks
- Images
- Links
- Lists
- Quotes, among others

This allows you to focus on the content without wasting time writing syntax manually.
